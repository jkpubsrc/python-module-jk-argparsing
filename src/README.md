jk_argparsing
=============

Introduction
------------

This module provides an API for processing command line arguments. There is ``argparse`` of course, but this API is better. Better means: Simpler, more easy to use.

Information about this module can be found here:

History
----------------------

Not every piece of software has a history. This module has.

Work on this module began over a decade ago in a complete different programming language: C#. As I required some command line tools in C# I implemented a .Net library for that purpose as there was nothing like that I could use. This library was so convenient that a) I prepared it for release under the Apache Open Source license and b) ported it to Python some years later.

So this python module here is based on that .Net library. It is basically a port of that library. However, year after year I improved that Python module bit by bit, so this Python module became a very convenient tool, way beyond the original capabilities of that .Net library.

The next sections provide detailed information about how to use `jk_argparsing`.
